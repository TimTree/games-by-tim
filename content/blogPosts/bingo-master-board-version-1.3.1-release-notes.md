I'm gonna take a break with those fun posts. For now, we got…you guessed it…another update to the Bingo Master Board! Here's your release notes:

<ul>
  <li>The "Themes"drop-down menu ended up slowing down the slideshow, so to replace that, I added a new slide for you to change the theme. That's why you will now see a new "Themes" tab.</li>
  <li>Added a new theme - <span style="color: purple;">purple</span></li>
</ul>

This should be the last update for the master board in a while. Have fun!
