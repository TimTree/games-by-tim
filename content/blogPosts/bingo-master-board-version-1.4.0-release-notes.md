Oohâ€¦another update to the Bingo Master Board! You see, I had this feeling that the master board really needed a black theme, so I made that and another theme in the process! Here's your release notes:

<ul>
  <li>New themes - <span style="color: #6fa8dc;"><b>sky</b> </span>and <span style="color: #444444;"><b>shadow</b></span></li>
</ul>

Note - You may notice that Bingo Master Board is now password protected. This is to prevent people from modifying my own PowerPoint idea.

Let me know what you think of the new themes!
