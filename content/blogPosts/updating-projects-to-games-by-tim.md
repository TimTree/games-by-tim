**The Games by Tim migration is complete! Old info below.**

Due to the site's recent name change, I'll have to update my projects to mention _Games by Tim_. Rather than make an update post for each project, I will keep track of my progress here.

The projects in the DONE list have been updated to say _Games by Tim_, along with the new version numbers if applicable. I still need to update the projects on the TODO list.
