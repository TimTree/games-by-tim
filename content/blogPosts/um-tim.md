What? Who's that?

_"I'm Ted. I'm some random imaginary person you just made up a few seconds ago."_

<br />

Oh, really.

_"Yes, really."_

<br />

Alright, Ted. What brings you here?

_"Well, I wanted to ask you some very important question."_

<br />

Um, ok. What's that question?

_"Hmm… I need to reword it so it sounds better."_

<br />

Ted, you don't need to. I can…

_"Hey, I'm trying to concentrate here._

<br />

But…

_"No BUTS! This question must be articulated so that it flows like soft velvet, swaying through a gentle breeze…"_

<br />

\*sigh*

_"…casting a ray of tranquility, flowing up to your heart in serenity…"_

<br />

Grrr.

_"…that reveals a glimpse of paradise, a view so beautiful that…"_

<br />

**OH SHUT UP!**

<br />

_"Hold on, Mr. Impatient! The words are not in harmony yet."_

<br />

I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT! JUST GIVE ME THE QUESTION ALREADY!!!

_"The version that's not articulated?"_

<br />

\*moan* Yes, the version that's not articulated.

_"Alright, alright! growls_ The question is…

<br />

**_WHY THE HECK DO YOU UPDATE A BLOG THAT NO ONE EVEN READS OR CARES ABOUT ANYWAY?!_**_"_

<br />

Um, well, it's hard to explain…

_"I don't care if it's hard to explain! Give me the reason, NOW!"_

<br />

Well, how about if I give you, um, a deal?

_"WHAT deal?"_

<br />

How about if I spend time rewording the answer so it articulates better?

_"And the CATCH?"_

<br />

The catch is, you'll have to wait.

_"GRRR! Waiting is stupid! I want, I want, I want…"_

<br />

Now look who's Mr. Impatient?

_"FINE! I'll WAIT for the reason. But you gotta make it SNAPPY. OR ELSE…"_

<br />

Or else what?

_"Or else…er…I'll find out."_

<br />

O-kay…

_"And no trying to get away with it!" *leaves_*
