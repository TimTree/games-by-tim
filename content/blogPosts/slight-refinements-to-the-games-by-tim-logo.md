Today, I made some minor adjustments to the site's iconic cursor logo. Notice the rounded cursor edges.

<div class="image300"></div>

<p align="center">Old</p>

<div class="image300"></div>

<p align="center">New</p>

Also, since the logo's redone on Inkscape instead of PowerPoint, there's now an SVG variant. This was my main reason to redo the logo, in preparation for a site overhaul.
