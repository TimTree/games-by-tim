Curious how I made the two Vista Point artworks ([V1](/vista-point-v1/), [V2](/vista-point-v2/)) on this site? Now you can find out, because today I'm releasing the source PowerPoint files for both artworks!

The two artworks are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Enjoy!
