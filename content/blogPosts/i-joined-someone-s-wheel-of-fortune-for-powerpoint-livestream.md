Today, I had the privilege to join a Wheel of Fortune livestream, hosted by [Ryan Budds](https://www.triviawithbudds.com/). Ryan hosted Wheel of Fortune for PowerPoint for over 2 hours.

Overall, the livestream was a success. Not only did I get a full-blown demonstration of someone other than me using my template, I got to join in a few rounds and discuss the project to an engaging audience. They seemed to really enjoy the game!
