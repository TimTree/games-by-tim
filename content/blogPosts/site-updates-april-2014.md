I finally went through and updated the blog once and for all to take it out of the PowerPoint days. Here's what happened:

* I updated the **About** page so it is more relevant to what the blog is now.
* I changed the name of the **Download** page to **Projects**, since I am now making HTML5 games, and those games don't need to be downloaded to play.
* I updated the **Coming Soon** page. That page hasn't been updated for two years!
* After two and a half years, I've finally added a new **prototype**: Oscillation mode for Button Masher! Go to the Projects page to check it out!
