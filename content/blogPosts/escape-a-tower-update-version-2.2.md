So apparently, I was an [HTML criminal](http://line25.com/articles/10-html-tag-crimes-you-really-shouldnt-commit). (See crime #3 and #5.)

The result of this article is an update to my text adventure, Escape a Tower. The patch fixes most of the past crimes committed, plus a few other changes. Here are the release notes:

* Formatting fixes for Firefox, Internet Explorer, and mobile devices.
* Added the option to erase save data on the bottom of version history.
* The file size has decreased (by 5 KB).

The link to Escape a Tower has also changed, as I am starting to transfer my games from Dropbox to Github. [Here is the new link.](http://timtree.github.io/escape-a-tower/) (A lot more clean the the Dropbox link, right?)

Thanks for checking out the update.
