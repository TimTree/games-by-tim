A minor update for the LibreOffice version of Bingo Master Board (v1.0.1) was released with the following adjustments:

* **Removed the PLUS branding** to simplify the name. It was redundant anyway.
* **Fonts are now embedded.** Although this results in a larger file size, the template should now render properly on various Linux distros, including Ubuntu.

I am aware I'll have to update screenshots as a result of the name change. I'll get to that when I have more time.
