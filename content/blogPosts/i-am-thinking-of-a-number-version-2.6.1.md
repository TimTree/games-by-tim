I was play testing version 2.6 with my friends the other day, and we all concluded that the sophisticated number guesser could become _even more_ sophisticated. Behold, the result of our ideas: version 2.6.1! 

* **After you guess, you can now press the enter key to go back to the guessing screen.** If you're playing on a desktop, you're going to love this.
* **An error message now appears if you guess out of your number range.** Say you're guessing between 1 and 1000. The game is now smart enough to not accept your guess if it's below 1 or over 1000!
* **If you lose Internet while playing, you'll no longer lose access to this game if you go to the main menu.** This should be a relief if you're playing on the go.
* **Shrinks the title font.** So it looks better on mobile devices.

 Keep on guessing, folks!
