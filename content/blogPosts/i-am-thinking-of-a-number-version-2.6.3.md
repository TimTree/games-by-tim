Here's a minor update that contains a neat enhancement and a bug fix.

* **Improved correct screen.** It tells you the correct number and what number range you guessed from. Now you can brag to your friends when you guess from 1 to a million!
* **Bug fix.** There was a minor issue with the game using an incorrect minimum number. That has been fixed.

As always, keep on guessing!
