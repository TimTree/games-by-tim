Escape a Tower Version 2.3 has been released with several fixes.

* **Fixes** [**HTML5 validation**](http://validator.w3.org/) **issues.**
* **Erasing save data now only deletes Escape a Tower data.** Before, if you deleted save data from Escape a Tower, all your local storage data was removed, even Button Masher/Keyboard Masher scores. This has been fixed.
* **IE8 support.** This was the result of fixing the HTML5 validation issues, so if you happen to use this outdated Internet Explorer version, you're in luck.

Once again, thanks for checking out this update.
