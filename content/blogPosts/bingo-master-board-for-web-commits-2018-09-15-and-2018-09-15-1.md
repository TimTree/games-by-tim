Got you guys two commits today, which I will combine into a single blog post.

## Commit 2018-09-15

* **The How to Use page is ready to go.** It's organized into sections so it's easier to follow through. For instance, you'll find the keyboard shortcuts in Tips & Tricks.  
    
  Have a good look at it; this is the longest time I've spent working on instructions.

## Commit 2018-09-15-1

This commit focuses on **optimizations**, especially for iOS devices.

* **Fonts and images now preload**, which should reduce jumpiness throughout the UI.
* **On iOS devices, double-tapping will no longer inadvertently zoom in the page**. You can still pinch to zoom if you so desire.
* **On iOS devices, the page is now fixed** so you won't inadvertently scroll the board up and down.
* **Fixes font size issues for some iOS devices**
