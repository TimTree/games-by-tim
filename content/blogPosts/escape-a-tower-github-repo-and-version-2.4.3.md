Now that I got the hang of GitHub with Bingo Master Board, I'm migrating my older projects to their own repos. I begin with **Escape a Tower**, as I recently got the urge to work on it.

This means:

* **You can view development commits.** Previously, any update I upload would become live on the Web. Now I can commit changes without making it live. This helps me recover my code if anything happens, and you get to see my work in progress!
* **You can watch the project.** If you have a GitHub account, you can watch Escape a Tower to receive emails whenever I release new updates.
* **You can star the project.** If you really like the game, you now have the ability to star it on GitHub.
* **You can more easily report game issues** on GitHub with the Issues page.

To get things started, I posted Escape a Tower version 2.4.3. This minor update:

* Corrects grammatical errors
* Updates links to Games by Tim
* Removes deprecated appcache

As mentioned in the GitHub Releases page, a more substantial update (version 2.5) is coming soon. Keep an eye for commits in the Develop branch!
