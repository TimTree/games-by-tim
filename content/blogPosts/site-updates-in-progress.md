It's not just you; the Games by Tim site does look a tad different than it used to.

I'm currently restructuring the site in an effort to improve site usability. I have quite an extensive todo list, so I'm slowly implementing my planned changes.

You may notice weird pages or wacky layouts as I work on the site. I'll do my best to keep the site in a useable state whenever I take breaks from development.

Once I finish the site updates, I will write a blog post describing the changes more in detail. If you have any questions regarding the site in the meantime, feel free to leave a comment here.

**Note:** I've uploaded the above image to test for the new favicon.
