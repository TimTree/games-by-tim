Welcome to a new update for _I am Thinking of a Number_, the sophisticated number guesser. In the previous version, I improved on the game's mechanics, allowing players to guess more efficiently than ever before. Now, with this version, I focus on the game's appearance and design. Number guessing has never _looked_ better than before!

So what has changed visually? Allow me to walk you through that.

* **New fonts.** Out with the boring Arial font, in with the much improved fonts! The font you will see has been optimized for your operating system.
  * iOS 9 or OS X El Capitan Safari will use the **San Francisco** font.
  * Older versions of iOS/OS X or using Firefox/Chrome on a Mac will still use the **Helvetica Neue** font.
  * Windows will use the **Tahoma** font.
  * Android will use the **Roboto** font.
  * Ubuntu will, surprise, use the **Ubuntu** font.
  * All other operating systems will use their sans-serif font.
* **New buttons.** The game now uses stylized buttons, which should look more consistent than the previous default buttons.
* **New favicon.** That 1k looks slightly different now.
* **New app icon.** Shown above. The 1k now uses the San Francisco font and a new gradient background. This should look much better than the previous solid white design.

I hope that you too agree that the new design is a step in the right direction. If you want to reference the old layout, version 2.6.3 awaits you in the [Archive](/i-am-thinking-of-a-number-older-versions/).

\* Yes, I know Segoe UI is the Windows system font, but I chose Tahoma instead since Segoe UI is more difficult to read. I didn't want to sacrifice function for form.
