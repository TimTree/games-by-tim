_So Many Numbers_ is at it again!

This time, I rewrote the game layout. Why, you ask? I'll let the screenshots speak for themselves.

In addition:

* Fixed bug that counted blank inputs as 0
* Fixed text display issues with Microsoft Edge
* Fixed bug that generated 30-30 more often than it should

Have fun with the improved layout and fewer bugs!
