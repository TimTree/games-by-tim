If you beat and liked [Escape a Tower](https://tower.gamesbytim.com), you may have noticed that I recommended the game [Magical Diary](https://hanakogames.itch.io/magical-diary-horse-hall). I mainly recommended Magical Diary for the dungeon crawlers that may remind you of Escape a Tower's puzzles. I also appreciated the game's premise, depth of choices, and jaw-dropping routes you wouldn't expect in a wizard school simulator.

Anyway, I recently noticed that there's a Kickstarter campaign for the sequel, Magical Diary: Wolf Hall. I normally don't promote other people's projects on my blog, but I'll make an exception here. **If you too liked Magical Diary, you should back this game.**

To be clear, I was NOT paid to write this post. I just wanted to spread the word about a game I've previously recommended. If the campaign interests you, [**here's the Kickstarter link.**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hanako/magical-diary-wolf-hall-a-wizard-school-rpg-dating/)
