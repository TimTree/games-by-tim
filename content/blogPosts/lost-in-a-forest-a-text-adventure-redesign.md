If you haven't played _Lost in a Forest_, now's the perfect time to do so. And if you've already explored every nook and cranny of it, that's not the case anymore, because starting today, **I am introducing an all new redesign of the game**.

Here's what changed:

* **New fonts** - The text adventure should look much more lively than it did before.
* **Choice box hover effects** - They now change color for better feedback.
* **Every other choice you make has a different color** - This change is intended to make it easier to distinguish where you are in the story.

And the biggest change of them all...

* **Animated choice boxes** - That's right! Not only does it make the entire game more robust, it's also fun to click the choice boxes for the heck of it now.

All these changes have been made possible through the use of **jQuery**, a popular Javascript library. This is my first attempt at using it, and I hope to utilize its potential in other upcoming projects.
