If you read the blog posts here often, you may have noticed that starting today, the tab names aren't what they used to be.

Previously, if you were to read this blog post, you'd get this tab name:

**Tim's Slideshow Games: Tab names look different? Here's why.**

Now, you're probably seeing this name instead:

**Tab names look different? Here's why. - Tim's Slideshow Games**

I didn't know it was possible to change the tab names on Blogger until I came across [this blog post](https://www.bloggertipstricks.com/post-title-before-blog-title.html) today. The benefits of this adjustment are twofold:

1. It is easier to identify two different tabs on this blog.
2. Search engine optimization (SEO) of my projects should improve since search engines prioritize the first few words of a Webpage title.

If you also use Blogger and want to improve your blog visibility and navigation, I recommend you make the same changes, using the guide on the above linked blog post.

Hopefully this helps those who read my blog and other blog writers alike.
