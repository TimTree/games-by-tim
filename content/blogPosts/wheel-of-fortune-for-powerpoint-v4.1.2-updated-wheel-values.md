Missed the last feature update? [v4.1/v4.1.1 release notes](/blog/wheel-of-fortune-for-powerpoint-version-4.1/)

***

It has come to my attention that [the actual show received new wheel values as of April 2019](https://wheeloffortunehistory.fandom.com/wiki/Wheel_of_Fortune_timeline_(syndicated)/Season_36#April_2019), albeit a minor one.

Thus, this Wheel of Fortune for PowerPoint update (v4.1.2) takes in the new wheel values.

## Try the Web wheel demo!

As mentioned before, I'm working on a Web-based successor to Wheel of Fortune for PowerPoint. Right now, you can test the new wheel, which contains numerous improvements over the PowerPoint counterpart. [Click here](https://wheeldemo.gamesbytim.com/) to try the wheel (and [complete the survey](https://forms.gle/oBiGSo1aivxQbdHp7) if you wish).
