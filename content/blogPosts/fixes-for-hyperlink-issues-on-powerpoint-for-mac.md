Some PowerPoint 2016, 2019, and 365 for Mac users have encountered a bug in my projects that causes certain hyperlinks to take two clicks, instead of one, to activate. Unfortunately for us, it's a PowerPoint for Mac-specific flaw that's been [unresolved for over three years](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mac/forum/macoffice2016-macpowerpoint/hyperlink-problem-in-slideshow/a8fe275b-d8a7-473b-a81b-5f5a182107d9).

However, it turns out **if you add spaces to the project filenames, the hyperlink problem goes away.** Don't ask me why; it just is what it is.

I would have re-uploaded Flashcards for PowerPoint and Wheel of Fortune for PowerPoint, but GitHub Releases does not allow spaces in filenames. Therefore, if you encounter the hyperlink problem in these projects, **you should rename the file to include spaces.**

<p align="center">
  Example: rename the file<br/>
  <i>WheelofFortuneMac4.1.1.pptm</i><br/>
  to<br/>
  <i>Wheel of Fortune Mac 4.1.1.pptm</i>
