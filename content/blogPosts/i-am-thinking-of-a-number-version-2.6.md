Welcome to version 2.6, a spectacular update to the "I am Thinking of a Number" series. After a multitude of bug fixes to the 2.5 branch, it's about time for a new feature release. The focus is on productivity; each feature is designed to enhance your number guessing efficiency.

So let's get right to the release notes.

* **Adds the ability to choose the starting number.** Ever wanted to guess between 10 and 50 or -223 to -32? Now you can! The starting number to guess from is no longer locked at 1. You can change it to whatever integer you want, even negative numbers!
* **The game now keeps track of the numbers you guess.** If you're guessing with a number set, any number you've already guessed will now appear blue. If you're guessing with an input field, a list of guessed numbers will appear on the bottom of the page. This comes in handy whenever you're guessing from a large number range.
* **Input field auto focus.** Now whenever you're guessing with an input field, you no longer have to click on the input field to start typing your number. It automatically does that for you!
* **Defaults to the numeric keyboard on mobile devices.** If you're playing on an iPhone or iPad, you no longer have to change your keyboard setting to number mode every time you guess. That's one less tap on your end!
* **Other minor tweaks.**
  * If you guess a number wrong, the game now informs what you just guessed.
  * If you're on iOS or OS X, the default font has changed to Helvetica Neue, the font used on OS X Yosemite.
  * Enabling the greater than or less than hint no longer triggers an alert box. That's one less click to deal with!
  * Increases the size of the input fields.
  * Updates the About page.
  * The dialogue is less harsh if you use hints.

So as you can see, the game is a lot more sophisticated now. You'll be guessing faster than ever, which will make it even easier for you to become a professional number guesser. So what are you waiting for? Let's get guessing!
