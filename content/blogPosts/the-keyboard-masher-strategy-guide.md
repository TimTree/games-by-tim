Last month, I published the Button Masher Strategy Guide, providing a myriad of strategies to amp up your game. Now it's Keyboard Masher's turn. If you're seeking to become so good at keyboard mashing that you'll become a viral maniac on YouTube, welcome aboard!

## Achievement Star Requirements

<ul>
<li><span style="color: blue;"><b>Blue star</b></span> - Beat one of the beat the creator scores.</li>
<li><span style="color: #38761d;"><b>Green star</b></span> - Beat every single beat the creator score.</li>
<li><span style="color: #7f6000;"><b>Bronze star</b></span> - Reach 2500 presses (Typing on Task).</li>
<li><span style="color: #666666;"><b>Silver star</b></span> - Reach 10000 presses (Typing Tempest).</li>
<li><span style="color: #bf9000;"><b>Gold star</b></span> - Become a typing typhon (25,000 presses).</li>
</ul>

Keep in mind that the green star overwrites the blue star, and the gold star overwrites the silver star, which overwrites the bronze star.

## Tips and Tricks

* **Play when you're angry.** Keyboard mashing is supposed to be frantic, and when you're angry, you become more crazed and hyper. Consider playing a frustrating video game to pre-anger yourself.

* **Learn to play the piano.** I once met a guy who was good at Keyboard Masher, and I mean REALLY good (over 1700 on 30 seconds). When I asked him how he got those scores, he told me that he played the piano when he was younger. I can see how this may have helped him.
* **Find the keyboard that best suits you.** Not all keyboards are created equal. For instance, laptop keyboards tend to have a different feel from desktop keyboards. Also, some keyboards require more force to press a key than others.

  When researching keyboards, you may encounter mechanical keyboards with their customizable key switches, keycaps, layouts, cases, and more. This is an entire hobby of its own. If fine-tuning a keyboard from the ground up intrigues you, feel free to dive deeper. Just beware: once you have a mechanical keyboard, you'll want another. And another. *Endgame does not exist!*

  * **Regarding n-key rollower (NKRO):** Most keyboards are six-key rollover (6KRO), meaning they register a maximum of six keys pressed at once. Keyboards with NKRO, when enabled, can register any number of keys pressed at once. If your keyboard supports NKRO, go ahead and harness its effects. Just keep in mind that scores with NKRO are NOT like-for-like with 6KRO scores. **All Beat the Creator scores were done with 6KRO.**
* **Arrow Mode Tips** - I have my left index finger on the up key, and three fingers from my right hand on the left, down, and right keys. What I do is repeatedly press the key on the screen until the arrow changes. This is because sometimes, the key stays the same. And since you're using different fingers for every key, it's easy to switch off when the arrow key changes.
  * However, in **Arrow (360)**, I use only my right hand. I find that with a predetermined set of arrows to press, it's easier to use one hand than two.

  * As of version 4.5, **you can use WASD keys** in addition to arrow keys. While the change is intended for accessibility, you can use it to your advantage. For instance, have your left hand on WASD on your right hand on the arrow keys so both hands can control the game equally.
* **Alphabet Mode Tips** - While it's possible to complete this mode by mashing the keyboard, it's actually more time efficient to legitimately type the letters. Also, try not to look at your keyboard when typing, as that could either slow you down or cause you to yell swear words when you realize you forgot to type the letter D. Practice, practice, practice!
  * **Alphabet (Backwards)** may seem intimidating at first, but you'll get the hang of it once you start memorizing the letters you need to press. Keep practicing!
