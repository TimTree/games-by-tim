Has PowerPoint been crashing on you every time you try to open one of my games? That's because of a recent Windows Update, labelled KB3097877. Intended to be a security update for Windows Vista, 7, and 8, KB3097877 crashes not only PowerPoint but all supported versions of Outlook as well.

Until Microsoft gets their act together, **please uninstall KB3097877 if you want to play my PowerPoint games.** Here's how:

1. Open Windows Update.
2. In the bottom of the left side bar, click on **Installed Updates**.
3. On the top right search box labelled _Search Installed Updates_, type KB3097877.
4. Right click the update that shows up and select **Uninstall**.

To prevent KB3097877 from installing again, you'll need to hide the update. To do this, right click it in your list of updates to install and select **Hide update**.

If you don't see KB3097887 when searching for installed updates, that means it's not installed, and you should be able to open my PowerPoint games properly. **If you're using OS X or Windows 10, you may disregard this entire post.**

I'll update this post as soon as I get more information about the PowerPoint crashes. Let's hope Microsoft doesn't screw things up again.

**UPDATE:** [**Microsoft has fixed the crashing issues.**](/blog/you-can-install-kb3097877-now/)
