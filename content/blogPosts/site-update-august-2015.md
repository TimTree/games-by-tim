If you have a keen eye, you may have noticed that **bold text** looks a tad better than before, especially if you've been using Chrome for Mac.

Why is this? Well it turns out when I previously changed the blog font to PT Sans, Blogger never imported the bold version of the font. This meant that whenever I specified bold text in my blog, it was up to your browser to render the font. The result was what's known as [faux bold](http://alistapart.com/article/say-no-to-faux-bold). This would make bold text appear blurry for most browsers, and on Chrome for Mac, bold was barely visible if at all.

To remedy this, I manually imported the bold version of PT Sans from Google Fonts to this blog. Now every browser should see the true bold PT Sans, not the fake one.
