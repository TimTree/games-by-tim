Tired of people saying your PowerPoint game doesn't work because they didn't enable macros?

## Let them know in the game.

Attached is a step-by-step tutorial on how to add macro checking to your PowerPoint projects. I can confirm fewer macro-related issues on my own projects with this, so I hope it helps you too.

The guide should be straight-forward, but let me know if you have any questions.
