short_description: Help me the test the 3rd Masher Series game
title: Mouse Swipe Prototype

**Update (10/1/2015):** The full game has been released. The prototype is no longer available.

## ~~[Click here for the prototype.](http://timtree.github.io/mouse-swipe-prototype)~~

~~**Welcome to Mouse Swipe**, the third game in the Masher Series. In this game, your goal is to swipe your cursor across the vertical line as many times as you can.~~

~~Since this is a demo, only 10 second mode is included. The full game will feature additional game modes that I still need to think of. Fortunately, **any save data from this prototype will be transferred to the full game once it's released.**~~

~~If you have any thoughts on this prototype or ideas for game modes related to mouse swiping, feel free to post a comment. I'd greatly appreciate all the feedback I get during this testing phase.~~
