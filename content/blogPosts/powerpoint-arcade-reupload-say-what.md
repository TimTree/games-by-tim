It has come to my attention that PowerPoint Arcade was password-protected for editing. Since this game is discontinued, I see no reason why you guys shouldn't be allowed to edit the file. Unfortunately, I forgot what the password was.

Luckily, I found the PowerPoint Arcade file I used for development purposes that has no password. Therefore, I reuploaded the game with this file. Keep in mind this is a .pptx file instead of .ppsx, so you will need to start the slide show manually.

Just to be clear, **PowerPoint Arcade is still discontinued.** I am only removing the password, that is all. If you ever hoped to tinker with this old project after all these years, today is your lucky day.
