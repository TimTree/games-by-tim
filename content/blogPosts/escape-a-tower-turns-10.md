Happy 10th anniversary to my first game published on the Internet!

To celebrate the momentous occasion, you can try the first part of the **discontinued** sequel Journey to Home. It's the quest back to your humble abode after escaping the tower.

The sequel would have added core enhancements like images and a hint system. Sadly, due to the massive amount of work making images (and other factors), I lost motivation to finish development.

That said, I don't want what I did develop to go to waste, so I'm releasing what I got, knowing for sure I won't continue the project. I wrote most of the game in 2015, so what you'll see may not reflect my current development practices.
