**Update (Nov 10): The migration process is complete.**

After six years of service, I am planning to retire MediaFire and migrate all of my downloadable projects to Google Drive. The reason? Unlike MediaFire, Google Drive does not serve ads while downloading and appears to be more robust to use.

For cleaner download links, I am using my Github page to process download queries. Here's an example on how it works. The below URL,

[https://timtree.github.io/download/bingo-master-board-plus/](https://timtree.github.io/download/bingo-master-board-plus/ "https://timtree.github.io/download/bingo-master-board-plus/")

will download the latest stable release of Bingo Master Board PLUS.

To download a specific version (in this case version 1.0), you'd add the following parameter to the URL, like so:

[https://timtree.github.io/download/bingo-master-board-plus/?ver=1.0](https://timtree.github.io/download/bingo-master-board-plus/?ver=1.0 "https://timtree.github.io/download/bingo-master-board-plus/?ver=1.0")

So far, I have only moved Bingo Master Board PLUS to Google Drive. The migration process will take a while for all projects, especially the old ones. So for the time being, expect a mixture of MediaFire and Github -> Google Drive based download links. I'll edit this post when I'm done migrating every project.

Hope this proves to be a better download experience!
