The good news is, I have released the full version of Wheel of Fortune for PowerPoint! Here are your release notes:

* Fixes the bug that occasionally spins the wheel when clicking on "Go Back"
* Added a calculator link, which takes you to the Windows calculator.
* Added a Themes option. Now you can change the theme to Beta 1, Beta 2, or the brand new Default.
* Added "How to Use" section

I hope you will enjoy all these fixes and new features in the brand new version of Wheel of Fortune!
