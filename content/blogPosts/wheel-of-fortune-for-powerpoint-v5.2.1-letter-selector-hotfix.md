Wheel of Fortune for PowerPoint version 5.2.1 addresses a bug that caused the Letter Selector to not appear on puzzle load if the computer's system region is a non-UK European country.

This bug has also been patched in the [pre-release dev build 2021-05-27](/blog/wheel-of-fortune-for-powerpoint-dev-builds-are-back/). Version 4.1.5 (the latest version that supports PowerPoint 2007) is not affected by this bug.
