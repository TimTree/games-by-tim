**UPDATE:** (sigh) This isn't actually my first YouTube video. [The cliff jumping video](/blog/cliff-jumping-powerpoint-video-on-youtube/) is.

Well guys, I've finally done it. There is now a video guide for Wheel of Fortune for PowerPoint available in case you prefer using videos over the How to Use slides. Took me a lot of courage and attempts to get this going, so I really hope this pays off.
