Last night, I dreamed about being submerged in a pile of Bingo balls. I'm probably going restless about this project, but I can't stop now. The stable release is getting close!

Here's what I got for today's commit.

* **The winning pattern is back.**  
  It works just like Bingo Master Board PLUS with a few differences:
  * The Bingo card in the slide page is on the left side. I changed this so you don't have to move your cursor as much to edit the winning pattern.
  * You get a nice fade effect when editing the winning pattern.
* **Show number of drawn Bingo balls by default**

Now that I've ported every feature from Bingo Master Board PLUS, it's time for me to work on the instructions, credits, and refinements. Expect the commit rate to increase as I grow increasingly anxious about finishing the project!
