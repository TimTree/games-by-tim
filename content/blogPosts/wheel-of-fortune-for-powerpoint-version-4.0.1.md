Updating from version 3.2 or older? Be sure to check out the [version 4.0 release notes](/blog/wheel-of-fortune-for-powerpoint-version-4.0-final-welcome-to-a-new-era/) to get caught up on all the major changes.

***

Well, there's always that one part of the game I forget to test. As such, here's version 4.0.1, which includes the following fixes:

* **\[FIX (Mac only)\]** The buy vowel and transfer totals buttons now work properly with large money values. The Windows version was not affected.
* **\[FIX\]** Adds an error message if a user sets the vowel price or house minimum beyond the maximum integer value.
* **\[CHANGE\]** If a user attempts to load a puzzle when none exist, a new message box guides the user to the Set Up Puzzles editor.

I would like to thank Marius Benadie from YouTube for helping me identify the Mac buy vowel/transfer totals bug.

_Version 4.0.1 was re-released a few hours after this post to adjust the performance of the puzzle existence code._
