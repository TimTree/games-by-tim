Yet another update has been put into the Bingo Master Board. Here are the release notes:

* Added "About" page. Click on the copyright on the title slide to see it.
* Slideshow is now set to "Browse at a Kiosk." This removes the distracting buttons on the bottom left-hand corner of the powerpoint. It also disables slide advancement by arrow keys.
* Minor bug fix
