**UPDATE (Nov. 1):** Since secure connections (HTTPS) are now enforced in Github Pages, you will no longer be able to access the unencrypted versions of the Masher Series games.

Original post:

Recently, I've rerouted all the links for Button Masher, Keyboard Masher, and Mouse Swipe to the HTTPS protocol. While this is ultimately a good thing, as your connection to all my games [should be private and secure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS) from now on, your save data unfortunately did not transfer during the conversion.

~~Rest assured though: **your save data is still alive**. If you continue to access the unencrypted (HTTP) versions of the games, you will be able to continue your progress just as before. However, if you wish to convert to the secure (HTTPS) versions, you'll have to start the games all over again.~~

~~I know it's a bummer, but I'm sure that in the long run, you'll appreciate the benefits of using a secure connection. But if that doesn't click with you, don't worry: you'll indefinitely be able to access the unencrypted versions of the games, even when they're updated. All you have to do is delete the "s" from "https" in the URL or click on the provided links below:~~
