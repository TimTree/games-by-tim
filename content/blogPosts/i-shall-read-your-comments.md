Have I not been responding to your thoughtful comments/suggestions on this blog? Rest assured, it's NOT because I don't care about you guys.

It turns out the email I had set for comment notifications was my old address, one that is no longer in active use. To remedy this, **I've rerouted the comment alerts to my main email address**, which I keep an eye on a daily basis. So from now on, I should be aware of your comments within a day or so. This means you can **expect speedier responses from me than ever before!**

So go ahead, bring on your comments. Your voice shall no longer be unheard!
