Today, I've made some slight tweaks to the hyperlink colors.

* **A normal hyperlink** looks slightly bluer than before, improving contrast with ordinary text.
* **A visited hyperlink** now appears purple instead of dark blue. Not only does this improve contrast, it is easier to tell which links you've clicked on and which ones you haven't.

I hope these changes help you out for the better. If you have any suggestions, remember to leave a comment. Thanks!
