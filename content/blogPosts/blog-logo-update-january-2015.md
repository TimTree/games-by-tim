Today, I continue to improve this blog by uploading a new version of the logo. It may look the same as the previous one, but there are some key differences. For one, **the background is now transparent.** This is how I wanted the logo to look in the first place, but since I didn't know how to do that three years ago, I used a workaround of making the background white with the rest of the layout. Also, **the colors are more vibrant.** It also happens to use less height than the previous logo did.

For the record, here are the two logos side by side. See if you can spot the difference.
