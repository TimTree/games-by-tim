Hi there, pranksters. Did ya enjoy scaring your friends with that [gigantic "BOO!"](/blog/hey-kids-wanna-scare-the-heck-out-of-your-parents/)? Well, I hope you did. This time, I got something even better:

### The Frozen Desktop!

Here's how to pull off this trick:

1. Take a **screenshot** of your computer's desktop (with no applications running).
2. Open **Microsoft PowerPoint**, and create a new presentation.
3. On PowerPoint 2007 or later: click on the **Design** tab on the ribbon, then click on **Page Setup**.  
   On PowerPoint 2003 or earlier: click on **File -> Page Setup**.
4. On the new window that appears, change the slide size to the **aspect ratio** of your computer (4:3, 16:10, or 16:9).  
   _To find your computer's aspect ratio, try each aspect ratio and start the slideshow. The correct ratio will make the slide fill up all four corners of the screen._
5. Now **upload** the screenshot of the desktop onto the PowerPoint presentation.
6. **Resize** the screenshot so it fills up the entire slide.
7. On PowerPoint 2007 or later: click on the **Slideshow** tab on the ribbon, then click on **Set Up Show**.  
   On PowerPoint 2003 or earlier: click on **Slideshow -> Set up Show**.
8. Change the show type to **Borrowed at a Kiosk**. This prevents your parents from seeing the arrows on the bottom left corner of the PowerPoint.
9. **Start** the presentation and put your computer into s**leep**.

The next time someone turns on the computer, they will be shocked to find out that nothing happens if they click on anything! **Little does that person know the only way out is by pressing the "Esc" key!**

So pranksters, let me know what you think. Did it work? Did it fail? Did you end up getting tricked? Discuss in the comments!
