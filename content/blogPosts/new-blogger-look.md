As you may have known, Blogger has been given a redesign today, mainly to fit in with the new Google look.

My impressions?

Well,

I kind of like it. It's gonna take some getting used to, though.

What do you think of the new Blogger interface?

<br />

P.S. This is my first Blogger post using the new look!
