**Update (2020):** As of the 2020 site overhaul, the Archive has been removed. Instead, you can find older versions of each project on their respective project pages.

~~Now it's possible to browse through most of the older versions of my projects! To access the archive, click on the new link,~~ [~~Archive~~](https://gamesbytim.com/p/archive.html)~~, on the top navigation bar. Along with the links/downloads, there are notes written about every version posted. Who knows, you might learn some cool trivia about the development of my games!~~

~~Keep in mind that some archived versions have been modified from its original. I only did this if there were any game-breaking bugs from the original that needed to be patched. Other than that, I did NOT touch any other aspect of the game.~~

~~I hope you're able to learn something new or at least get a good laugh from the archive.~~
