**What?** _Another_ update for the master board? Are you insane? Do you have a life? Why the heck are you posting so many updates for this thing?!

Well, you see, right after I posted version 1.2.0 onto this blog, I came up with an idea for the board. Not a lame idea, but something that _might_ actually catch your interest.

Here are the release notes:

<ul>
  <li><b>THEMES!</b> Tired of having to use the boring yellowish background every single time you use the bingo master board? Now you can change the theme to <span style="color: #38761d;">green</span>, <span style="color: blue;">blue</span>, <span style="color: red;">red</span>, or even <span style="color: red;">r</span><span style="color: orange;">a</span><span style="color: #bf9000;">i</span><span style="color: #38761d;">n</span><span style="color: blue;">b</span><span style="color: #073763;">o</span><span style="color: purple;">w</span>! Just choose your selection using the new "Select Theme" slide.</li>
  <li>To reduce clutter on the master board, the "Reset Board" button has been renamed to simply "Reset".</li>
    <li>The title slide now has a quick fade transition.</li>
</ul>

_Coming Soon: a "Themes" drop-down menu bar_

Also, I may add more themes throughout each of the updates! If you have any theme suggestions, just post a comment on this blog!

Enjoy!
