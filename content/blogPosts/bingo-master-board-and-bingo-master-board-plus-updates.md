**HEADS UP!**

**Bingo Master Board for Web will soon replace Bingo Master Board (PowerPoint) and Bingo Master Board PLUS.** The new Web version will have all the features of Bingo Master Board PLUS, along with some not possible with PowerPoint. You can try the work-in-progress build [**here**](https://timtree.github.io/bingo-master-board/).

As such, **Bingo Master Board (PowerPoint) and Bingo Master Board PLUS are now in maintenance mode**, which means I'll only release bug fixes if necessary. Once Bingo Master Board for Web gets a stable release, both PowerPoint projects will officially be discontinued.
