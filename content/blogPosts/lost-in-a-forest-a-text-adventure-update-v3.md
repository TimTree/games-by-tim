Sometimes, I like to touch up my old projects. Here's such a time with Lost in a Forest - a Text Adventure.

Highlights of this update include:

* **Endings tracker** - See how much more of the text adventure you've yet to cover!
* **Rounded layout** - Much of the game UI now features smooth, curved edges.
* **Improved contrast** - Choice toggle backgrounds are darker so they're easier to read.
* **Refactored JavaScript** - The code looks way more nice and efficient than before.
* **Dedicated GitHub repo**, available [here](https://github.com/TimTree/lost-in-a-forest)
* **New gamesbytim link**: [lostforest.gamesbytim.com](https://lostforest.gamesbytim.com/)

I actually wrote the majority of this update shortly after [the previous 2016 release](/blog/lost-in-a-forest-a-text-adventure-redesign/). That means for the most part, the game code resembles my style from years ago. I have to admit it was fun to relive the old way I coded and to reflect on how far I've progressed.
