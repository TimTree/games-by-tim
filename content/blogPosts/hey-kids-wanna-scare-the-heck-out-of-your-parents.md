It's easy! All you have to do is [click here](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=17dmijPMANg2qPtFm0FTOAJ3v9s_bUEVi) to download a scary PowerPoint presentation. Then, start the slideshow and put the computer in sleep. The next time your parents turn on the computer, watch them scream in intense fear! Mwa ha ha!

Enjoy your Halloween, kids! (boo!)
