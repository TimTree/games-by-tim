_So Many Numbers!_ has a new update. If you primarily play the game on your smartphone, this one's for you.

* **The game now uses a numeric keypad.** This gives your fingers more headroom to zip through those numbers!

* **UI adjustments** - You should see less things overlapping or cut off when playing on smaller devices like the iPhone SE.

Keep at it with those numbers! Smartphone users, I look forward to your improved times.
