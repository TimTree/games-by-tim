The new Wheel of Fortune season kicked off this week, and with it came a change to the wheel. This update for Wheel of Fortune for PowerPoint reflects that change and improves puzzle loading performance.

**New to version 6.1.2**

* To align with season 39 changes, the **orange $950** on the wheel has been replaced with a **yellow $850**
* The setting **Base Value** has been renamed to **Values Range** with more descriptive toggle names: $300-$900 and $500-$900
* **Loading puzzles no longer slows down** when you have 100+ puzzles

**Fun fact:** [The Free Play wedge no longer exists on the actual show](https://www.buzzerblog.com/2021/09/08/wheel-of-fortune-gets-multitudes-of-little-changes-for-39th-season/) starting with the new season. Since this template [already removed the Free Play wedge by default](/blog/wheel-of-fortune-for-powerpoint-v6.0-holy-smokes/) a few months ago, we were ahead of the curve!
