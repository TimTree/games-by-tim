Hi!

This is my brand new slideshow game blog. Cool, huh?

Anyway, in this blog, you have the ability to download my very own slideshow games I made from PowerPoint! It's a lot more convenient than than sending out e-mails, and this way, I can get a bigger audience! Woo hoo!

I will begin uploading my first slideshow games soon, so while you're waiting, check out the "About" page on the tab header. You'll learn about how this site works and stuff.

Have fun!
