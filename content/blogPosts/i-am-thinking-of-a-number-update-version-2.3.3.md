Thanks to my new Javascript knowledge, I was able to once again reduce the file size of this game. Here's what happened this time:

* The file size has decreased once again (by 0.22 KB)
* Fixed a title formatting issue with Firefox

And of course, the link has changed from the Dropbox one to Github for a cleaner look. [Here is the new link.](http://timtree.github.io/i-am-thinking-of-a-number/)

Enjoy! And if you feel like it, check out the new try catch statement I used for the customgame function. It's something new I've learned today.
