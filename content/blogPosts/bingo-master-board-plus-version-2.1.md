**Bingo Master Board PLUS Version 2.1** is out. The most notable change is that I rewrote the VBA using "Option Explicit". I'm not really sure why this is important other than it's good programming practice, but hey, I followed through.

Other changes include:

* Various alignment adjustments
* You can now display the number of Bingo balls drawn. This may be more useful for Bingo players than the amount remaining.
* Bingo Master Board PLUS is now licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.
* Fixes a bug in PowerPoint 2007 that prevented new themes from loading
