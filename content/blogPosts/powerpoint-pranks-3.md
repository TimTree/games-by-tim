Alright pranksters! Time for my newest creation…

### Huh? Where's da Screen?!

Another really easy trick to pull off! Here's how to do it:

1. Make a PowerPoint in where there's just one slide. This slide should be blank, with a black background.
2. Click on Slideshow -> Set up Show, and change the show type to Borrowed at a Kiosk. This prevents your parents from seeing the arrows on the bottom left corner of the PowerPoint, ruining the trick.
3. Start the presentation and put your computer to sleep.

That's it, only three steps! The next time someone turns on the computer, all they'll see is a black screen! They'll be wondering why their screen is left blank!
