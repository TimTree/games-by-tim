The first update to Flashcards for PowerPoint is here!

Based on user feedback, many of you guys preferred viewing the amount of starred flashcards as a number, rather than a percentage. In other words,

15 total flashcards 4 starred

is preferred to

15 total flashcards 26.7% starred

That's why starting with version 1.1, **it is now possible to toggle the starred cards count within Settings**. Simply click on the text, and the count will switch between a number and a percentage. The number is shown by default.

I hope this update improves your studying experience.
