Time to roll out some more updates! This surprisingly huge Escape a Tower patch focuses on three major categories:

* **Lots of formatting improvements**
* **Visual enhancements**
* **Bug fixes**

Due to the sheer quantity of adjustments I've made, I will simply list the entire changelog at the bottom of this post. In summary, I've rigorously reformatted the game to fix some HTML validation issues and to make things look more consistent across browsers. I've also squashed some wandering bugs I've discovered in the process. All these refinements should improve the overall gameplay experience.

## Detailed Changelog
