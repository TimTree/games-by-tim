[So Microsoft finally got their act together.](http://www.infoworld.com/article/3004441/microsoft-windows/microsoft-surreptitiously-reissues-botched-patch-kb-3097877-for-windows-7.html)

After reinstalling KB3097877, I can now confirm that my PowerPoint games are working again. Therefore, **you SHOULD install the update now to get the latest security fixes**.

Let's hope this fiasco never comes to us again.
