Google recently [released an update](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/10729743?hl=en) for Google Drive that affects most files uploaded before 2018. For security purposes, the download links for these files have to be updated to include a resource key.

The download links for the following projects on Games by Tim were affected by the update and have been fixed:

* [Memoric Trivia](/memoric-trivia/)
* [Make Your Own Memoric Trivia](/make-your-own-memoric-trivia/)
* [Rebus Puzzles Galore](/rebus-puzzles-galore/)
* [Deal or No Deal on Paper](/deal-or-no-deal-on-paper/)
* [Cursor Adventure](/cursor-adventure/)
* [PowerPoint Arcade](/powerpoint-arcade/)
* [iPad Pro (2015) Screen Size PDF](/blog/ipad-pro-screen-size-pdf/)
* [Wheel of Fortune for PowerPoint Solution Cards](/blog/wheel-of-fortune-for-powerpoint-solution-cards/) (for use on versions 3.2 or earlier)

**Please note:** Only the latest versions of each project have fixed download links. If you need an older version of any of the above projects, [contact me](/contact/) for assistance.
