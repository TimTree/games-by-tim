Google recently [released an update](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/10729743?hl=en) for Google Drive that affects most files uploaded before 2018. For security purposes, the download links for these files have to be updated to include a resource key.

The download links for the following projects on Games by Tim were affected by the update and have been fixed:

* Memoric Trivia
* Make Your Own Memoric Trivia
* Rebus Puzzles Galore
* Deal or No Deal on Paper
* Cursor Adventure
* PowerPoint Arcade
* iPad Pro (2015) Screen Size PDF
* Wheel of Fortune for PowerPoint Solution Cards (for use on versions 3.2 or earlier)

Please note: Only the latest versions of each project have fixed download links. If you need an older version of any of the above projects, contact me for assistance.
