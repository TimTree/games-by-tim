Apple announced the iPad Pro in their special event today, and I have to say, it's very impressive. Its screen size is listed at 12.9 inches, which is bigger than many laptops in the market today, including Apple's own 12 inch MacBook.

To get a feel of what this massive display is like, [I made a printable PDF of its size](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByTdG9SyZ1imeXU4M0RQOW52eUE/view). See how huge the new iPad Pro's screen is for yourself!
