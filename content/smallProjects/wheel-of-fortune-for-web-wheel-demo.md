Here you'll find a tech demo of the wheel I intend to use for Wheel of Fortune for Web, the upcoming replacement for [Wheel of Fortune for PowerPoint](/wheel-of-fortune-for-powerpoint/).

Wheel of Fortune for PowerPoint's wheel took two clicks - one to spin, and one to stop. This wheel needs just one click, and hold it to charge the new strength meter!

**Advantages over the PowerPoint wheel**

* More sense of control over the wheel (although the outcome's still completely random)
* Has inertia - will slow down as it spins
* Uses the [crypto-random API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Crypto/getRandomValues) to securely determine where the wheel stops
* Can programmatically tell what value the wheel landed at

## **Take the survey!**

~~For the first time in the site's history, I'm trying out a survey to gauge how to further improve the wheel.~~ [~~Click here for the survey.~~](https://forms.gle/oBiGSo1aivxQbdHp7)

**The survey closed February 11, 2020.**

## **To Do**

* Add multiple wheel types to choose from
* Add the wheel's second layer (wild card, Mystery wedge, etc)
* Add sound effects to the wheel

Note that I'm long ways away from releasing Wheel of Fortune for Web. I'm just sharing these types of demos in the meantime.
