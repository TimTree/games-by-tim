Introducing music to Games by Tim! In addition to making games, I've developed an interest in composing music with a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation). I'm still a beginner, but I hope someday to create music good enough for future games to come.  
  
To start off, I present _Intervals of Harmony_, created with Logic Pro X and completed on July 13, 2014. It features a simple melody, with instruments gradually entering in to enhance the music. Enjoy!  
  
To download the MP3, right click the audio player and select "Save audio as."
