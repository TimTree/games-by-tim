_I am Thinking of a Number_ - the sophisticated number guesser.

It originates from an infamous PowerPoint game that made users guess a number from 1 to 1000. It has since evolved to HTML5, offering hints and increased flexibility.

### **Features**

* Guess with a number set or an input field.
* Choose any combination of integers to guess from.
* Use hints to assist with guessing.
* Playable on desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.
* Toggle between a light and dark theme.
