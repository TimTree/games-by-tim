* <a href="https://github.com/TimTree/wheel-of-fortune-ppt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">**Open-source VBA**</a> so you know this is safe to use

This project reached 80,000+ downloads as of this writing. Thank you all for your support!

**Compatible with PowerPoint 2010 or newer for Windows, and PowerPoint 2011 or newer for Mac.** When prompted, you'll need to enable active content and/or macros for the game to work properly. Wheel of Fortune will NOT work on PowerPoint Viewer, PowerPoint Online, or PowerPoint Mobile because they don't support macros.

PowerPoint 2007 users can find an earlier release in [Older versions](/wheel-of-fortune-for-powerpoint-older-versions/).
