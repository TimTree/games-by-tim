Wheel of Fortune for PowerPoint lets you host your own Wheel of Fortune games with your own puzzles. It's great for your next party, class activity, social gathering, or video chat!

* **Create limitless puzzles** with the built-in editor.
* **Invite 2-4 contestants/teams.**
* **Easily keep score** with the Value Panel and dedicated buy vowel/transfer totals buttons.
* **Play multiple rounds** from the game show, such as the mystery and bonus round.
* **Spin the included wheels, or use your own.** It's up to you!
* **Animate the stage**, and **toggle the backdrop** of your choice.
* **Open-source VBA** so you know this is safe to use

This project reached 70,000+ downloads as of this writing. Thank you all for your support!

**Compatible with PowerPoint 2010 or newer for Windows, and PowerPoint 2011 or newer for Mac.** When prompted, you'll need to enable active content and/or macros for the game to work properly. Wheel of Fortune will NOT work on PowerPoint Viewer because it doesn't support active content.

PowerPoint 2007 users can find an earlier release in [Older Versions](/wheel-of-fortune-for-powerpoint-older-versions/).
