Now you can be the host of your own Wheel of Fortune game! Grab your contestants, and use this PowerPoint file to get your game going. It's great for your next class activity, party, or social gathering.

* **Create your own puzzles** with a built-in editor
* **Play multiple rounds** from the game show, such as the mystery and bonus round
* **Animate the stage**, and **toggle the backdrop** of your choice
* **Quickly keep score** with Quick Add and dedicated buy vowel/transfer totals buttons
* **Open source VBA** so you know this is safe to use

This project reached 70,000+ downloads as of this writing. Thank you all for your support!

**Compatible with PowerPoint 2007 or newer for Windows, and PowerPoint 2011 or newer for Mac.** When prompted, you'll need to enable active content and/or macros for the game to work properly. Wheel of Fortune will NOT work on PowerPoint Viewer because it doesn't support active content.

**PowerPoint for Mac users:** If you encounter issues with hyperlinks, [rename the file to include spaces](/blog/fixes-for-hyperlink-issues-on-powerpoint-for-mac/).
