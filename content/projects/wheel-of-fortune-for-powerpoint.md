[**See the FAQ for commonly-asked questions.**](/wheel-of-fortune-for-powerpoint-faq/)

This project reached 150,000+ downloads as of this writing. Thank you all for your support!

**Compatible with PowerPoint 2010 or newer for Windows, and PowerPoint 2016 or newer for Mac.** When prompted, you'll need to enable macros for the game to work properly. Wheel of Fortune will NOT work on PowerPoint Viewer, PowerPoint Online, or PowerPoint Mobile because they don't support macros.

PowerPoint 2007/2011 for Mac users can find an earlier release in [Older versions](/wheel-of-fortune-for-powerpoint-older-versions/).
