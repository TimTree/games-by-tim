**Works on smartphones, tablets, and desktop devices, dark mode compatible**

Your goal in So Many Numbers is to solve 30 math problems as fast as you can. You can fine-tune the game to a chosen level (simple or standard) and set of operators (+, −, ×, and ÷).

So Many Numbers is designed for those of all ages. It helps children and adults sharpen their mental math skills and offers a competitive challenge for enthusiasts alike!

## About the Project

Ashley Caswell and I (Timothy Hsu) created So Many Numbers during the Make School Summer Academy 2018 hackathon. After Make School, I continued to develop the game to what you see now. You can view the old repository [here](https://github.com/So-Many-Numbers/So-Many-Numbers.github.io).

So Many Numbers marks my first Web project to utilize a JavaScript framework (Vue), after rewriting the game in September 2019.

**My current record (standard difficulty, all operators): 35.1 seconds**
