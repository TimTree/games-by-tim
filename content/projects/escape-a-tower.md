It was a warm sunny day, and you decided to go downtown, to visit the bookstore.

That turned out to be a regretful decision.

Why?

Because on the way through an alley, someone evil guy kidnaps you, dragging you inside a ragged car, and, essentially, trapping you inside the top floor of a TALL, SCARY, TOWER.

In my very first computer game, your goal is to escape the tower (obviously), but it won't be easy. You'll have to click on the correct choices the game provides you in order to navigate through the traps, guards, dead ends, and locked passageways all around the tower. Make a wrong move, and BOOM! You get an instant GAME OVER.

Sounds, tough? Well, don't worry. Throughout the tower, there are items you can use to your advantage. Also, there are times when there is more than one way to traverse a section of the tower. And if you look carefully, you can uncover secrets that could easily help you find out what to do next (or not).

Oh, and something cool happens when you beat the game, but I won't spoil it for you.

Good luck trying to escape the tower!

**UPDATE (2014):** Escape a Tower is now playable in your Web browser as of version 2.0. You no longer need PowerPoint to play it, and it's also playable on mobile devices!
