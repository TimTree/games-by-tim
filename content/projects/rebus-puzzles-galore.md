_"Don't overthink it; the answer is right there."_

A rebus puzzle consists of a box that depicts a word or a phrase. Your goal is to decipher these words and phrases. In this PDF, there are 100+ homemade puzzles. Think you can solve them all?

You can also print this document into a booklet if you so desire. In fact, this is the first typed out book I've created!

Note to PDF readers: The answers to each puzzle are labelled with an A followed by the number. (A1, A2, etc.) Use them at your convenience.
