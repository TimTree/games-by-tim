Keyboard Masher is a spin-off of Button Masher, in the case that you mash the keyboard rather than a button. It was formerly a hidden unlockable in Button Masher. Keyboard Masher is HTML5 ready.

Keyboard Masher is part of the **Masher Series**, a collection of mashing related games. Check out [Button Masher](/button-masher/) and [Mouse Swipe](/mouse-swipe/), the other games in the series.
