Bingo Master Board, taken to the next level.

Bingo Master Board PLUS is a macro-powered PowerPoint that adds several key features from the original: The big one is the ability to draw Bingo balls within the presentation. That means you no longer need a mechanical roller or a separate program to play Bingo. Simply press a button within the master board, and it'll take care of the rest! You can also select a winning pattern and even hide the master board from view.

Despite its name, Bingo Master Board PLUS is free of charge. The VBA is also open source, so you can feel confident enabling those macros.

**Compatible With:**

* Microsoft PowerPoint 2007 or newer
* PowerPoint for Mac 2011 or newer  
  _You'll need to enable macros for Bingo Master Board PLUS to work._
