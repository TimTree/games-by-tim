Now you can project and play Bingo games using free open source software.

This LibreOffice version, a macro-powered presentation, tries its best to port as many master board features as it can from its PowerPoint brethren. Although not everything could be ported due to LibreOffice limitations, it retains the core PLUS feature: the ability to randomly (and manually) draw Bingo balls.

Need help setting this game up? [Click here](/blog/libreoffice-troubleshooting-tips/) for my troubleshooting tips.

**Compatible with:**

* LibreOffice Impress 5.4 or newer on Windows, macOS, and Linux

  _You'll need to enable macros for Bingo Master Board to work. Instructions can be found within the file and on my LibreOffice troubleshooting post._
