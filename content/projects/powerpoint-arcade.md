he PowerPoint Arcade is a minigame compilation I have made. The PowerPoint Arcade is a minigame project I decided to pursue. Basically, the arcade is a collection of PowerPoint minigames I have created. So far, there are five games, which are:

* Mouse Maze Challenge
* Reaction (demo)
* Memoric Trivia
* Wheel of Randomness
* What's my Number?

**~~The PowerPoint Arcade will be updated occasionally, so please give me feedback so I know what to include in the coming updates.~~**

**Update: This project has been discontinued**.
