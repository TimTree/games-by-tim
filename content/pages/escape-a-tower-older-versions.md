* Released November 21, 2012
* Final release for PowerPoint
* The game used to be called Escape the Tower. I renamed it because there was already an existing Flash game of that name.

### Versions 1.1 to 1.66 not available

* Back then, I'd overwrite the existing Escape the Tower file for updates, which meant I didn't preserve specific versions. I did, however, keep version 1.0.
