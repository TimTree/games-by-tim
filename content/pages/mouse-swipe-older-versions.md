## [Version 1.0](https://timtree.github.io/mouse-swipe/archive/1.0)

## [Prototype](https://timtree.github.io/mouse-swipe/archive/prototype)

* Released March 19, 2015
* Before I finished developing Mouse Swipe, I uploaded this prototype so people can get a feel of what to expect. Only 10 second mode was included, along with a promise that any save data would transfer to the full game upon release.
* The prototype's "send feedback" link no longer works.
